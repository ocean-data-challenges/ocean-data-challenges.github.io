## <center> Concept of the ocean data challenges </center>


---
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The concept of data challenges is fairly new and originates from the artificial intelligence community. It is now used by many instances to address targeted problems. The principle is straightforward: a problem of interest is introduced, adequately described and a set of data is provided to the participants in order to solve it. The goal is then to find the most accurate solution according to predefined metrics. Data challenges are often proposed by companies or entities to obtain a unique solution, the best solution, to their problem.

<div style="text-align: justify">
In our case, Ocean Data Challenges advocates for a more collaborative data challenge where the problem is co-defined in conjunction with the participants. Also, the algorithms used by the participants are open and shared. The results of all the methods are then discussed and analyzed as a group. This way, collaborative data challenges are appropriate platforms to gather forces and unite scientific groups. Moreover, in this configuration, the outcome of the challenges is not only the best solution to a problem but also a more nuanced and rich scientific understanding.

### [<u>L3 Preprocessing</u>](/dc_L3/)
<br> 
- [SWOT: OSSE filtering North-Atlantic](/dc_2022a/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
This Filtering SWOT in the North-Atlantic data challenge provides a platform to investigate the most appropriate filtering methods to reduce the uncorrelated instrumental (KaRIn) noise from the SWOT data.
</div>
<br>

- [SWOT: OSSE calibration Gulf Stream](/dc_2022c/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
This SWOT Calibration in the Gulf Stream data challenge provides a platform to investigate the most appropriate calibration procedures to reduce the spatially correlated errors from the SWOT data.
</div>
<br>

### [<u>Toy model mapping</u>](/dc_L4_QG/)
<br> 
- [QG simulation: OSSE SSH](/dc_2022b/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
The goal of this simplified altimetric mapping data challenge is to open a new entry point for people from other communities to play and bring their outside knowlegde to this oceanographic problem.
</div>
<br>

### [<u>SSH regional mapping</u>](/dc_L4_Reg/)
<br> 
- [Gulf Stream: OSSE SWOT/nadirs](/dc_2020a/) 

<div style="text-align: justify">
This data challenge investigates how to best reconstruct sequences of Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps in the Gulf Stream from satellite altimetry observations, including SWOT data, in a synthetic experiment.
</div>
<br>

- [Gulf Stream: OSE nadirs](/dc_2021a/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
This OSE nadirs data challenge is a follow-up of the previous one but with real altimeter data (and no SWOT). 
</div>
<br>

- [Mediterranean: OSE nadirs](/dc_2023a/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
Similarly to the OSE nadirs Gulf Stream data challenge, this one investigates how to best reconstruct SSH maps from real altimeter data in the West Mediterranean Sea.  
</div>
<br>

- [Californian Xover: OSSE SWOT/nadirs high-frequency](/dc_2023b/)

<div style="text-align: justify">
In a synthetic experiment setting, this data challenge investigates the mapping of nadirs and SWOT data (fast sampling phase) at high temporal frequency (hourly).
</div>
<br>

### [<u>SSH global mapping</u>](/dc_L4_Glob/)
<br> 
- [OSE nadirs](/dc_2023d/)
