## <center> <b> Collaborate to ODC and propose your own data challenge </b> </center>


---
 
 
 
### To have your data challenge appear on the ODC website, nothing simpler ! 

<br> 

- 1) Fill the informations related to your data challenge into a yaml format

- 2) Provide us with these info

<br> 

#### 1) Fill the informations related to your data challenge into a yaml format: 

<br> 

<pre>
  <code>
    - id: "your_DC_id"
      title: "your_DC_name"
      creationdate: 2024 
      experiment: "your_DC_experiment_type"
      region: "your_DC_region"
      url: https://your_DC.github.io
      url-readthedocs: https://your_DC.readthedocs.io
      url-opendap: https://your_DC_data.html
      image: your_image.png
      text: 'Description'
      articles: 
          - 'Article 1'    
          - 'Article 2'       
  </code>
</pre>

To respect this template, you need to: 

- choose any id you want (hopefully one that does not already exist),
- provide the title/name of your DC (don't make it too long), 
- choose **your_DC_experiment_type** from ```"l3_processing"```, ```"ssh_mapping"``` and ```"current_mapping"```, 
- choose **your_DC_region** from the existing regions (```"North Atlantic"```, ```"Gulfstream"```, ```"Mediterranean"```, ```"California"```, ```"Agulhas"```)
- provide at least the github url of your DC in ```'url:'```
- you'll need to include your illustration image in 'images/' repository at the root of the website folder,
- provide some brief description and article references linked to your DC if there are any. 


Note, that if either **your_DC_experiment_type** or **your_DC_region** do not correspond to any proposed option, you'll have to [contact us](/contacts/) so we setup a specific section in the website for your data challenge. 

<p>An example from the first 2020 data challenge is:</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    - id: DC2020a

      experiment: "ssh_mapping"
      region: "Gulfstream"

Here, the url-readthedocs is not provided since the 2020 DC does not have an associated readthedocs website. 


#### 2) Provide us with these info 

<br> 

To do so, you can either: 

- clone the [website github repo](https://github.com/ocean-data-challenges/ocean-data-challenges.github.io), add your yaml input in the ```_data/datachallenges_yml.yml``` file and your illustation image in ```images/``` and make a pull request of these modifications.

- contact us directly at [Contacts](/contacts/) and send us directly these info, we'll update the website for you.
