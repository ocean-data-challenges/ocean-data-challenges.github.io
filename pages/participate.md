## <center> <b> How to participate to a data challenge </b> </center>

---

### 1) What you need to participate

<br>

- **A Github account,**

- **Conda installed on your computer,**

- **Some ideas or methods to test !**

<br>
 
### 2) How to propose a solution 

<br>

**_In the name of open-science, we hope that you can provide your codes or point to an existing repo of your codes. However, this does not constitute a restriction on participation._**  

<br>

The only restriction to participate is that:

<span> <center> <a> Participants must provide the evaluation notebooks than ran for their methods.</a> </center>  </span>

<br>

Example evaluation notebooks are available in each data challenge repo. 

<br> 

### 3) Details on the different steps

<br>

All data challenges have repositories hosted on GitHub. In those repositories you will find readme files that explain:
- the context and motivation, 
- how to clone and setup the conda environment of the data challenge, 
- how to download the necessary datasets and
- how to start playing. 

Some data challenges also have readthedocs web pages that illustrate and explain in a more fancy way the data challenges. 

In other words, you will need to :

- Create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one), 
- Go to the data challenge GitHub repository of your choice,
- Follow the instructions to clone the repo, install the conda environment (you'll need to install conda if you don't already have it) and download the data, 
- Play with the data and evaluate your performances using the example notebooks, 
- Finally, do a pull request to provide your notebooks containing your results. 


For anymore details or clarifications, do not hesitate to contact us through the github Issues section of a specific data challenge or directly at [Contacts](/contacts/).
