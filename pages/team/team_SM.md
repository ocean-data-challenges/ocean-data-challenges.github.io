![Sammy]({{ site.urlimg }}team-SM_273x273.png "Sammy Metref")

I am a research engineer specialized in data assimilation and inverse methods for oceanographic applications. In particular, I worked on the BOOST-SWOT ANR project to update the DUACS optimal interpolation method in anticipation of the SWOT satellite data. More recently, I have acquired an expertise in the formulation of data challenges with, amongst others, the creation of several "ocean-data-challenges". I joined Datlas in August 2022 to bring this altimetric mapping and data challenge expertise to the team.
