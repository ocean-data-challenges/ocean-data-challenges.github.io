I am a research engineer in Datlas since Jan. 2022. I have specialized in spatial oceanography, my main interests being the production of new high-level altimetry products (L3 and L4) and derived Ocean indicators. I am strongly involved in the preparation of future missions and I investigate new reconstruction methods for fine scale sea surface height mapping.
